![Ryan Oglesby](./profile.jpeg) Hi! I'm Ryan. I write code for a living. I also write code-related things down here sometimes.

I currently work as a developer at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com), which has taken me on a whirlwind journey through building enterprise-scale systems using multiple languages, coaching junior devs, working with small start-ups, mobile development, and being a trainer for our intensive new-hire training program in India - so far. More recently, I call myself a Tech Lead and I prefer to hang out with Front-end tech.

When I'm not coding I am staying active - rock climbing, snowboarding, playing volleyball, or galavanting around the world.
