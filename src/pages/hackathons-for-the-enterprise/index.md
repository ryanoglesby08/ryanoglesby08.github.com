A few months ago I helped to plan and execute a Hackathon for my project team. Though it was not the first team Hackathon I have participated in, it was the most successful. Everyone on the team had a great time and learned a lot. Some of the hacks have even been turned into production solutions for the product or team!

I decided to take this experience and share it with a wide audience by contributing to the [ThoughtWorks Insights](http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights) blog. This is extremely exciting for me, as its my first time to be featured alongside so many of my brilliant colleagues! :)
