How would our\nday-to-day interactions and development practices have to change in order for less experienced team\nmembers to grow while being productive? I was pretty excited about this initiative, as I enjoy\nmentoring others to become better software developers and being part of effective, high-performing\nteams.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>Our definition for Apprentice Developer: <br /> Entry-level Dev. Probably none or less than a year\nof full-time professional experience in software development.</p>\n<p>First some background, in the past few months we have been supporting a couple Apprentice-level\ndevelopers with various amounts of success. Until now, the development team had been a bit loose in\nadhering to XP practices, such as pairing. Sometimes we would, sometimes we wouldn’t. Sometimes we\nwould switch pairs every day or so, but there was no real cadence to it. Being a small agile team (7\ndevs), this kind of thing was fine for awhile, but we could easily see that adding more\nless-experienced devs would require a tad more structured of an environment.</p>\n<p>Our first step was to take on honest look at our dev team culture and how everyone was responding to\nit. We discussed the worries that the team had and we solicited feedback from the current Apprentice\ndevelopers centered around how the team had supported them, and what areas there might be for\nimprovement.</p>\n<p>We came to the conclusion that we would identify five new development practices that promote a more\nsupportive and safe environment for Apprentice-level developers. So we carved out about two hours to\ncome up with them, which I facilitated. To start things off, we narrowed our focus just a bit by\ncreating a few categories that we thought would have challenges from the initial group discussion\nnotes and feedback. From here, we took about five minutes to do some divergent thinking and come up\nwith as many ideas as we could for addressing anything in any of the categories. After reviewing,\nclarifying, and grouping similar ideas, we each used five votes to start converging on the ones that\nwe wanted to take further. It looked like this.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/dev_practices_brainstorming-13db928f4cafe63a953a6a3622efe2ec-9b0e7.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 119.16666666666667%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Dev team practices brainstorm"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/dev_practices_brainstorming-13db928f4cafe63a953a6a3622efe2ec-f8fb9.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/dev_practices_brainstorming-13db928f4cafe63a953a6a3622efe2ec-e8976.jpg 148w,\n/static/dev_practices_brainstorming-13db928f4cafe63a953a6a3622efe2ec-63df2.jpg 295w,\n/static/dev_practices_brainstorming-13db928f4cafe63a953a6a3622efe2ec-f8fb9.jpg 590w,\n/static/dev_practices_brainstorming-13db928f4cafe63a953a6a3622efe2ec-9b0e7.jpg 600w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Next, we discussed the ideas one-by-one in descending order of votes, with the outcome of each\ndiscussion being a tangible, immediately-implementable practice for the team.

I had my own ideas and biases. Though I consciously tried not to let them interfere\nwith any discussions, I’m sure that happened a little bit. That is probably unavoidable and a big\nreason why an outside facilitator for exercises such as this one is preferable.</p>\n<p>I also could have watched the time a little better. It took over 2 hours, which I feel was way long.\nWe got off track quite a few times. And the discussions after voting may have been a bit too open\nended. Looking back, having a set time box for each post-vote discussion may have provided just\nenough time pressure to spur the group to create something tangible a bit quicker.</p>\n<p>At the end of it all though, the team agreed upon five new practices to enact right away. The\nunderlying goal was to help support new Apprentice developers, but I think the entire team,\nregardless of experience or skill level, will benefit from them. I’m looking forward to seeing how\nit goes and how the team grows!</p>',frontmatter:{title:"How to Support Apprentices on an Agile Development Team",date:"January 26, 2015"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/how-to-support-apprentices-on-an-agile-development-team/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/testing-jasvascript-web-workers-with-jasmine/"},frontmatter:{title:"Testing JavaScript Web Workers with Jasmine"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/easing-into-rubocop-with-git/"},frontmatter:{title:"Easing into Rubocop with git"}}}}}});
